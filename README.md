- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sanatan-Shrivastava. Currently, I'm a graduate student at the Computer Science department at The University of Texas at Dallas. Currently, I am actively looking for internships for summer of 2023 in the Software Development/Engineering.
In the past, I have interned at Samsung SDS India with the overseas group working on software development for the teams in American Region.
- 👀 Moreover, I have also worked on several research projects during my undergraduation. One in particular, where my team and I worked on finding diagnosis to Dysgraphia - A Handwriting Disorder using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms. Also worked on developing a web-portal for data ingestion. My research interests are Distributed Systems, Algorithms, AI in Healthcare and FinTech.
- 💊 Totally interesting fact: In my free time, I am studying hormones. Making a sense out of large datasets and capturing the impact of hormones on our day to day lives, and how to maximize productivity by regulating these very hormones. Interesting? I know right!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on topics that are directly or indirectly related to my research field.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at ✉️ sanatan.shrivastava@utdallas.edu for any engineering or research related opportunity. At UT Dallas? DM me, let's catch up!
